This is the official PyTorch implementation of the paper "**Accelerating Reinforcement Learning with Learned Skill Priors**"
(CoRL 2020).

## Updates
- **[Jul 2021]**: added robotic office cleanup environment 
(see [details & installation here](spirl/data/office/README.md))
- **[Apr 2021]**: extended improved SPiRL version to support image-based observations 
(see [example commands](spirl/configs/skill_prior_learning/block_stacking/hierarchical_cl/README.md))
- **[Mar 2021]**: added an improved version of SPiRL with closed-loop skill decoder 
(see [example commands](spirl/configs/skill_prior_learning/kitchen/hierarchical_cl/README.md))

## Requirements

- python 3.7+
- mujoco 2.0 (for RL experiments)
- Ubuntu 18.04

## Installation Instructions

Create a virtual environment and install all required packages.
```
cd spirl
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv -p $(which python3) ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies and package
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -e .
```

Set the environment variables that specify the root experiment and data directories. For example: 
```
mkdir ./experiments
mkdir ./data
export EXP_DIR=./experiments
export DATA_DIR=./data
```

Finally, install our fork of the [D4RL benchmark](https://github.com/kpertsch/d4rl) repository by following its installation instructions.
It will provide both, the kitchen environment as well as the training data for the skill prior model in kitchen and maze environment.

## Example Commands
To train a skill prior model for the kitchen environment, run:
```
python3 spirl/train.py --path=spirl/configs/skill_prior_learning/kitchen/hierarchical --val_data_size=160
```
Results can be visualized using tensorboard in the experiment directory: `tensorboard --logdir=$EXP_DIR`.

For training a SPIRL agent on the kitchen environment using the pre-trained skill prior from above, run:
```
python3 spirl/rl/train.py --path=spirl/configs/hrl/kitchen/spirl --seed=0 --prefix=SPIRL_kitchen_seed0
```
Results will be written to [WandB](https://www.wandb.com/). Before running RL, 
create an account and then change the WandB entity and project name at the top of [rl/train.py](spirl/rl/train.py) to match your account.

In both commands, `kitchen` can be replaced with `maze / block_stacking` to run on the respective environment. Before training models
on these environments, the corresponding datasets need to be downloaded (the kitchen dataset gets downloaded automatically) 
-- download links are provided below.
Additional commands for training baseline models / agents are also provided below. 

### Baseline Commands

- Train **Single-step action prior**:
```
python3 spirl/train.py --path=spirl/configs/skill_prior_learning/kitchen/flat --val_data_size=160
```

- Run **Vanilla SAC**:
```
python3 spirl/rl/train.py --path=spirl/configs/rl/kitchen/SAC --seed=0 --prefix=SAC_kitchen_seed0
```

- Run **SAC w/ single-step action prior**:
```
python3 spirl/rl/train.py --path=spirl/configs/rl/kitchen/prior_initialized/flat_prior/ --seed=0 --prefix=flatPrior_kitchen_seed0
```

- Run **BC + finetune**:
```
python3 spirl/rl/train.py --path=spirl/configs/rl/kitchen/prior_initialized/bc_finetune/ --seed=0 --prefix=bcFinetune_kitchen_seed0
```

- Run **Skill Space Policy w/o prior**:
```
python3 spirl/rl/train.py --path=spirl/configs/hrl/kitchen/no_prior/ --seed=0 --prefix=SSP_noPrior_kitchen_seed0
```

Again, all commands can be run on `maze / block stacking` by replacing `kitchen` with the respective environment in the paths
(after downloading the datasets).


## Starting to Modify the Code

### Modifying the hyperparameters
The default hyperparameters are defined in the respective model files, e.g. in [```skill_prior_mdl.py```](spirl/models/skill_prior_mdl.py#L47)
for the SPIRL model. Modifications to these parameters can be defined through the experiment config files (passed to the respective
command via the `--path` variable). For an example, see [```kitchen/hierarchical/conf.py```](spirl/configs/skill_prior_learning/kitchen/hierarchical/conf.py).


### Adding a new dataset for model training
All code that is dataset-specific should be placed in a corresponding subfolder in `spirl/data`. 
To add a data loader for a new dataset, the `Dataset` classes from [```data_loader.py```](spirl/components/data_loader.py) need to be subclassed
and the `__getitem__` function needs to be overwritten to load a single data sample. The output `dict` should include the following
keys:

```
dict({
    'states': (time, state_dim)                 # state sequence (for state-based prior inputs)
    'actions': (time, action_dim)               # action sequence (as skill input for training prior model)
    'images':  (time, channels, width, height)  # image sequence (for image-based prior inputs)
})
```

All datasets used with the codebase so far have been based on `HDF5` files. The `GlobalSplitDataset` provides functionality to read all
HDF5-files in a directory and split them in `train/val/test` based on percentages. The `VideoDataset` class provides
many functionalities for manipulating sequences, like randomly cropping subsequences, padding etc.

### Adding a new RL environment
To add a new RL environment, simply define a new environent class in `spirl/rl/envs` that inherits from the environment interface
in [```spirl/rl/components/environment.py```](spirl/rl/components/environment.py).


### Modifying the skill prior model architecture
Start by defining a model class in the `spirl/models` directory that inherits from the `BaseModel` or `SkillPriorMdl` class. 
The new model needs to define the architecture in the constructor (e.g. by overwriting the `build_network()` function), 
implement the forward pass and loss functions,
as well as model-specific logging functionality if desired. For an example, see [```spirl/models/skill_prior_mdl.py```](spirl/models/skill_prior_mdl.py).

Note, that most basic architecture components (MLPs, CNNs, LSTMs, Flow models etc) are defined in `spirl/modules` and can be 
conveniently reused for easy architecture definitions. Below are some links to the most important classes.

|Component        | File         | Description |
|:------------- |:-------------|:-------------|
| MLP | [```Predictor```](spirl/modules/subnetworks.py#L33) | Basic N-layer fully-connected network. Defines number of inputs, outputs, layers and hidden units. |
| CNN-Encoder | [```ConvEncoder```](spirl/modules/subnetworks.py#L66) | Convolutional encoder, number of layers determined by input dimensionality (resolution halved per layer). Number of channels doubles per layer. Returns encoded vector + skip activations. |
| CNN-Decoder | [```ConvDecoder```](spirl/modules/subnetworks.py#L145) | Mirrors architecture of conv. encoder. Can take skip connections as input, also versions that copy pixels etc. |
| Processing-LSTM | [```BaseProcessingLSTM```](spirl/modules/recurrent_modules.py#L70) | Basic N-layer LSTM for processing an input sequence. Produces one output per timestep, number of layers / hidden size configurable.|
| Prediction-LSTM | [```RecurrentPredictor```](spirl/modules/recurrent_modules.py#L241) | Same as processing LSTM, but for autoregressive prediction. |
| Mixture-Density Network | [```MDN```](spirl/modules/mdn.py#L10) | MLP that outputs GMM distribution. |
| Normalizing Flow Model | [```NormalizingFlowModel```](spirl/modules/flow_models.py#L9) | Implements normalizing flow model that stacks multiple flow blocks. Implementation for RealNVP block provided. |

### Adding a new RL algorithm
The core RL algorithms are implemented within the `Agent` class. For adding a new algorithm, a new file needs to be created in
`spirl/rl/agents` and [```BaseAgent```](spirl/rl/components/agent.py#L19) needs to be subclassed. In particular, any required
networks (actor, critic etc) need to be constructed and the `update(...)` function needs to be overwritten. For an example, 
see the SAC implementation in [```SACAgent```](spirl/rl/agents/ac_agent.py#L67).

The main SPIRL skill prior regularized RL algorithm is implemented in [```ActionPriorSACAgent```](spirl/rl/agents/prior_sac_agent.py#L12).

```

The general philosophy is that each new experiment gets a new config file that captures all hyperparameters etc. so that experiments
themselves are version controllable.
